🪷 Iris Flower Prediction using Logistic Regression

📘 Project Overview

This project uses Machine Learning to predict the type of Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.
The famous Iris dataset is used, and the model is built using Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn.
The goal is to classify the flowers into one of three species:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
